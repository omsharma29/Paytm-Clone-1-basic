## Build a basic version of PayTM
#Step-1 : Clone the repositry 
#Step-2 : npm install 
#step-3 : npm run dev for frontend and node index.js for backend 
#step-4 : 'http://localhost:5173/' go to /signup or /signin because '/' nothing represent in this project 

Here are few problem if you can able to solve 
1. change route to / = /dashboard
2. after signup it should go to signin
3. and their is problem related to database and transaction code that money is not transfering
4. and if I am testing backend money is getting debited from one account but not getting credited to targeted account
